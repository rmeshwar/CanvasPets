# CanvasPet üêæ

**CanvasPet** is a fun and engaging Chrome extension that motivates students to complete their assignments by taking care of a virtual pet. The pet thrives as you complete your coursework, and it gets progressively happier as your to-do list on Canvas becomes empty. 

This project was developed as part of **HackOHI/O 12**, and serves as a proof-of-concept aimed at boosting productivity through gamification.

## Overview
CanvasPet syncs with the user's Canvas account to fetch assignments and tracks their progress via Canvas' To-Do list. Completing assignments rewards the user with points, which can be used to purchase items and treats for their pet. The pet becomes happier and healthier the more assignments are completed.

Our focus is to make coursework more rewarding and engaging through pet-care gamification.
